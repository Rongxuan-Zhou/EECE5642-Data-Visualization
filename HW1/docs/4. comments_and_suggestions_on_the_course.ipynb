    "For interests outside of the syllabus, I am particularly interested in data visualization related to robotics, such as real-time sensor data visualization, robot motion path visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "For skills, I hope to learn to use tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python for efficient data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For improving training programs, consider adding more case studies, so students can apply what they learn to real-world projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For improving homework, I think the format of submission can be united to git repos, which clearly includes all kinds of files.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is more is that I believe this course will help me better understand and analyze data in robotic systems, optimizing robot performance and decision-making processes.\n"
