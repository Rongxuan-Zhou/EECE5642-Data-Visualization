Catalog Course Description: Introduction to relevant topics and concepts in visualization, including computer graphics, visual data representation,
physical and human vision models, numerical representation of knowledge and concept, animation techniques, pattern analysis, and computational
methods. Tools and techniques for practical visualization. Elements of related fields including computer graphics, human perception, computer vision,
imaging science, multimedia, human‐computer interaction, computational science, and information theory. Covers examples from a variety of scientific,
medical, interactive multimedia, and artistic applications. Hands‐on exercises and projects.

Grading
Students will be graded on class participation, three assignments, a mid-term examination, a mid-term project and a final project and presentation. The
final grade will be composed as follows:

Class Participation.................. 10% Homework............................. 30%
Mid-Term Exam..................... 20% Final Project........................... 40%

Final Project
The final project has two options: visualization demo design or software tool design. The basic idea of the two directions is the same which is to collect
some scientific data and visualize them. The demo design mainly focuses on the visual animations, 2D/3D graphics, video making, and computer vision
based visualization techniques. The tool design is mainly to design and implement a visualization tool that can analyze the data with any kind of
visualization concepts or formats, summarize some useful results/conclusions, answer questions, and provide suggestions or comments. The data should
be real data, which can be either collected by individual or borrowed from somewhere (with permission and acknowledgement). Students can use any


API or programming language they like. Students can work on the project by themselves or team up with other students in the class. The team members
cannot be more than two.

To grade the final project, three aspects will be considered. 1) proposal presentation (20%); 2) final project presentation (30%); 3) final project report
and software package (50%). Late submission without instructor permission may not be considered. Typically, we do not anticipate that the grades for
each team member will be different. However, we reserve the right to assign different grades to each team member if the efforts or contributions they
make are apparently different and unbalanced. Bonus points may be earned if the project shows significant novelty and large potentials for real-world
applications. Those projects may get our guidance for further paper publications.

Proposals and Reports
Please consider following contents when you prepare for your proposals and final reports:

- Project title
- Team members names, affiliations and emails (one or two members)
- The project option you choose (demo or tool)
- Motivations of the project
- Real-world applications
- Data source and background (in detail)
- Tools and programming languages used in the project
- Contributions of the work (the work by the authors)
- Novelty of the work (optional)
- Visualization techniques (need to present details)
- Division of work for each team member
- Challenges and solutions
- Future work, extensions, improvements
- Additional comments
- References (including all papers, links, source codes, etc.)

Project Presentations
PPT or PDF slides and demos can be used for final project presentations.

Submission
The presentation slides, the final report and software package should be submitted to Canvas on time, 5pm on April 23.
Policy: If submitting latter than 5pm without permission, we will reduce the score with a penalty of 20%. If submitting after midnight of today without
permission, we do not count it as a successful submission.
